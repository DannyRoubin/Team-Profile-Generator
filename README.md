# Team-Profile-Generator

## App Description

This app proves to be a useful team profile generator which allows the user to create a new team by creating a singular manager, and as many interns and engineers as need be.
The user begins the app by first running npm i to install the packages, then running 'node index.js' and answering the prompts that come up on screen. When the user is done adding employees, the user will simply answer 'n' to the question which asks if you'd like to add another employee and the html will be completely generated.

## Motivation Behind the project/why I built it

My motivation to create this project was to be able to easily create teams for group projects I will end up doing in this course and in further education

## Problems I came across during development

This was a very difficult project as a whole, simply because there was very many moving parts at once and many things could go wrong. I ended up getting stuck in promise land many times during the creation/testing of this app. Another issue I had was creating the test for the app since it has been a while since I worked with jest to test applications.

## What I learned from this project

Although this project was on the harder side, I did learn a lot, such as the usefulness of constructor classes and writing test code much better. This app also strongly encouraged me to
keep my code as clean and organized as I could to be able to better find errors within my code.

## App usage

To use this app, simply clone this github repo onto your machine. Open the Repo on your machine and type in npm i to install the packages and then afterwards simply run 'node index.js' to run the app. After the app finishes running you will be able to find your new team profile html page in the file. From there open the html file on your browser and view.
